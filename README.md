Live demo (current state): http://encouraging-ducks.surge.sh/

This project is a showcase for the feasibility of react in gaming. We would like to develop it open source, anyone can participate. If you have a PR merged you gain access as a co-contributor/maintainer. :-)

```jsx
/utils    - game state store, helpers
/models   - gltfjsx models, players, characters
/effects  - dust, trails, skids, shaders
/ui       - intros, heads up displays, leaderboards
```
